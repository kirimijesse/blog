Boring Shit Lyrics

[Intro]
I can be anything
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book
I can be anything
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book

[Verse 1]
Nowadays these niggas got tellin' ways
She like me when I was broke, now I am hella paid
Gettin' more money than that nigga that's sellin' weight
I can not hear y'all, loud radio, heavy bass
I get dough, pastries like I'm sellin' cake
Smoke gas 'til I levitate
You ain't never smoke that Jet Fuel
I got that from Uncle Snoop (yeah)
I kept that shit one seventy-five, like seven quarters
I fuck so much that I probably got like seven daughters
Boy you move too quick just like a rabbit
Run the game like tortoise
Fuck her to the morning
I think I'm immortal
I think I'm an alien
And got sent straight down from a portal (yeah)
Touch it from the back
And I swear that I won't record you (yah, yah)
Baby I'm not normal
Baby I'm not normal (no way)
They don't like us because we not normal
We can do anything and I won't bore you
It don't matter to you but you know I can afford you
You rock that Amethyst you know I can't ignore you
Watchin' Steven Universe, that's one hell of a story

[Hook]
You got guts, no glory, yeah
You got guts, no glory
You got guts, no glory

[Bridge]
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book
Take a look, it's in a book
